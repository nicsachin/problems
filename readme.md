## problem statement
### There are n players standing in a circle. Player standing at 1st position kills next player ( i.e. the player standing at 2nd player ) and gives gun  to next player ( i.e. the player standing at 3rd position ). Which player survives in the last ?

-To run this program just run "node gun" or "node logic" command in terminal

gun.js -> file contains live commentary of players  
logic.js -> only the logic will take less time to execute
